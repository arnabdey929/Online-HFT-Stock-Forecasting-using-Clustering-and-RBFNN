# Online-HFT-Stock-Forecasting-using-Clustering-and-RBFNN

This is an implementation of the paper : Online High-Frequency Trading Stock Forecasting with Automated Feature Clustering and Radial Basis Function Neural Networks
Link to the paper : https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16160

I have also used GMMs, as they are universal density estimators, and can outperform k-means for clustering.
I only used Microsoft LOB Level-1 data from LOBSTERDATA : https://lobsterdata.com/info/DataSamples.php
